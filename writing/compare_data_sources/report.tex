\section*{Introduction} 
The previous GSR for this project filed a FOIA request for US Farm Payments data in early 2022. After this project received 
the discs with data files in excel format (FOIA Data), USDA published all of the data on 
\href{https://www.fsa.usda.gov/news-room/efoia/electronic-reading-room/frequently-requested-information/payment-files-information/index}{their website} 
(Public Data).\\

The purpose of this report is to analyze and document differences between the data sources, and determine the path forward: 
continue periodically requesting data through the FOIA process, or switch to the Publicly available data.

\section*{Summary Statistics}
The tables below show annualized summary statistics for the two sources of data. Upon first glance, we see that the public 
data extends the horizon back to 2004 and up to 2022. It remains to be seen how complete those years' data are. However, 
judging by the count of records, 2021 appears to be rather incomplete in the FOIA data with 80K records as opposed to the 4M records 
in the public data. \\

From 2006 through 2009, all summary statistics are identical. From then on, however, we have more records, higher totals, 
weakly higher maxima, and generally higher sums in the Public Data. \\ 
This implies the public data is more complete, but it is unclear what was missing from the FOIA data.

\section*{Difference Tables}
The following pages include two tables of a similar flavor. Since we find above that Public Data appears to be more complete than 
the FOIA data, here we analyze the difference between Public and FOIA for each state by year (see \autoref{stateYearDiffTable}) 
followed by program by year (see \autoref{progYearDiffTable}). These figures are shown in Millions of USD to 
examine which categories contribute most to the difference between the two data sources. An analysis of these tables 
is included in the Summary section of this document

\section*{Distributions}
In the following pages, I visualize annual counts of transactions by month of the year. The main intent is to identify patterns and determine if we can 
confidently use 2022, treating it as complete.

\section*{Summary}
Beginning in 2010, the two different data sources diverge. The Public Data
has more records, a greater sum, larger mean payments, and often a higher maximum than does the 
FOIA'd data. 

\subsubsection*{Which states are most responsible for the difference?}
At first glance, it appears that there are many states that contribute significantly to the difference. However, upon close examination 
combined with the summary report (add ref), most of the states that show a subjectively large difference are the states that already receive the highest payout 
from these programs. States like Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Nebraska, Ohio, and Texas are among the highest earning 
states from these programs, so seeing discrepancy of say, \$36 million in 2015 in Iowa is a small proportion of the over all earnings 
in the state that year. \\

While there are many small discrepancies that certainly add up, the most standout difference is D.C. 
In fact, D.C. is omitted entirely from the FOIA data, so that difference is simply the inclusion of that region.
For a complete look at the programs relevant to the D.C. region, see the county-level summary report (add ref).

\subsubsection*{Which porgrams are most responsible for the difference?}
There are 7 programs that are worth noting, listed \autoref{tab:topMovers}. Upon quick glance at the 
summary report, the first 6 are the largest programs year over year. The last program, the Market Access Program (MAP) 
is omitted from the FOIA data. In fact, the MAP coincides with only one jurisdiction - D.C. Therefore, it appears that 
the largest difference between the data sources is due to the omission of the Market Access Program in the FOIA data. 

\begin{table}[H]
    \caption{Programs with largest change}\label{tab:topMovers}

    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
        \hline

        7610 & Market Access Program \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}



\subsubsection*{Can we trust that Public 2021 and 2022 data is complete?}
Reviewing The summary statistics, 2021 appears to represent a fairly typical year, suggesting that it is complete in the Public Data. 2021 
is clearly incomplete in the FOIA data with only 80K records as opposed to the 4M records. \\ 
By the sum of payments, 2022 is on track as a middling year at \$13 billion. However, this occurs 
with only 1.8 million transactions, well below the 4 million that is typical of previous years. 
These two pieces of evidence appear to point in different directions. To resolve the issue, we turn to 
the distribution chart for Public 2022 data. In each year, October is the month with the highest total 
payouts, conicident with the beginning of the Federal Government fiscal year. While the total number of 
payments seems low, the distribution of such payments appears reasonable. We can compare this distribution 
to that of a known incomplete year. FOIA 2021 is known to be incomplete, and its distribution shows only January is 
included in the dataset. Seeing all months represented in the Public 2022 distribution is evidence in favor 
of the data being complete. While we cannot be sure, unless further information is uncovered, 
it seems a reasonable to proceed with 2022 data. 

\subsection*{Recommendations}
I recommend using the full set of Public data
\begin{itemize}
    \item Complete data in 2021, assumed complete in 2022
    \item Assuming the USDA will update the Public website, incorporating future years will be a straightforward process 
    \item Public Dataset appears to be more complete across the board, providing updated figures for each year and jurisdiction, while incorporating the Market Assistance Program in D.C. 
\end{itemize}
