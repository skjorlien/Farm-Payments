\section{Estimate Log Marginal Utility of Expenditure}
\label{sec:org51ae6c7}
\begin{itemize}
\item For every farmer \(i\) in year \(t\), we compute \(\log \lambda_{it}\), where \(\lambda_{it}\) is the marginal utility of expenditures.
\item Define \(Y\) as the self-reported expenditure categories from the ARMS survey, and let \(Z\) be a measure of household composition (for instance, log household size)
\item Use python package CFEDemands to estimate \(\log \lambda_{it}\)
\end{itemize}
\section{Calculate \(Cov(\hat{\log \lambda_{it}}), \tau_{it})\) with OLS}
\label{sec:orgcfd052b}
\begin{itemize}
\item Let \(\tau_{it}\) be a vector of government program payments received by farmer \(i\) in year \(t\). That is, \(\tau\) is a matrix with with columns representing self-reported payemnts for the following programs: Price Loss Coverage, Market Facilitation Program, Agriculture Risk Coverage Program, Federal Crop Insurance, Direct Payments, etc.
\item Construct \(X_{it}\) as a vector of controls including other sources of income (both on- and off-farm income sources).
\item Estimate \(\beta: \hat{\log \lambda_{it}} = \beta \tau_{it} + \gamma X_{it} + \varepsilon_{it}\)
\end{itemize}
\section{Calculate \(Cov(\hat{\log \lambda_{it}}), \tau_{it})\) with 2SLS}
\label{sec:org1ccfcf7}
\begin{itemize}
\item Using external data on government payments, construct matrix of mean administrative payments by zip code \(z\) and by year \(t\).
\item With zip code-level cross walk on the ARMS data, merge administrative payments data so each individual has a vector of mean administrative payments at the zip code level.
\item Define \(\tau_{it}\) and \(X_{it}\) the same as in OLS step.
\item Define Z\textsubscript{it} as the matrix of zip code administrative payments.
\item Perform 2SLS using \(Z\) to instrument for \(\tau\)
\end{itemize}
